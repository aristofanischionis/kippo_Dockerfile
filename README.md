# Description

I created a Dockerfile for the kippo honeypot. (https://github.com/desaster/kippo).

I did this because I needed to run kippo on my local machine, in order to test my tool, [Honeyscanner: a vulnerability analyzer for honeypots](https://github.com/honeynet/honeyscanner), and test its efficiency against kippo.

The docker image in DockerHub (https://hub.docker.com/r/aristofanischionis/kippo).

The issue on the official kippo GitHub repo (https://github.com/desaster/kippo/issues/241).

Use at your own risk, kippo is not actively maintained anymore. It has a lot of outdated dependencies, please do NOT use it in production environments. Try [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie) instead.
